AppKonference is a fork of AppConference. It comprises a set of enhancements
needed to migrate a MeetMe application to AppConference.  The goals of this
project are scalability and stability focused on voice.

Here's the url to the AppKonference sourceforge site:

You can check out the code for the AppKonference project using subversion:

Here is a brief summary of the changes to AppConference:

Added commands to mute/unmute a conference, increase/decrease conference
volume, increase/decrease member volume, and start/stop moh for a member.

Changed play sound command so that more than one sound can be entered on
the command line.

Added conference parameter, max_users, that limits conference members to a user
specified maximum.

Added conference variable, KONFERENCE, which is set to MAXUSERS or KICKED after
exiting the application so that the reason for leaving a conference can be
determined in the dial plan.

Added application, KonferenceCount, was so that the member count can be used in
the dial plan.

Added new AMI event messages for mute status: ConferenceMemberMute,
ConferenceMemberUnmute, ConferenceMute, and ConferenceUnmute.

Added conference flags to ConferenceDTMF, ConferenceJoin, ConferenceState, and
ConferenceLeave AMI event messages.

Added "x" option so that when a moderator leaves callers get kicked.

Added "a" option which sets vad and telephone flags on conference entry.

Changed formatting of conference list command to include new listening
state and did some rearrangement so that the channel name is displayed without
truncation.

Fixes for locking: First, fixed the conference thread so that the
conference list lock is only locked when it's required. Second, changed the
conference mutex to a rdlock for greater concurrency. Third, changed the way
sounds are handled so the member lock is not held over calls to asterisk
procedures.

Fixes for compiling with asterisk 1.6 and ifdef'ing out video and/or text.

Added an examples directory for a simple AMI based application and web site.
